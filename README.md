# todos-api

I'm getting this random idea to build a todo app for the purpose of learning how to test a rest api in golang. While i'm doing it, i'm also want to learn how to make integration test for repositories (database) for it.

> I've found this article that helps me during the development [Golang Integration Testing Made Easy](https://www.gojek.io/blog/golang-integration-testing-made-easy)

### Disclaimer
This repository is just for learning purposes, so i'm not focusing on building a clean code production ready REST API, but to learn how i can do integration test for DATABASE & REST API.
